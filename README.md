# The WPC2.0 Database
This database was created by Qi Liu (sdqi.liu@gmail.com) and Honglei Su (suhonglei@qdu.edu.cn) from Qingdao University in 2019. We welcome everyone to carry on the test and propose the modification opinion. If you use our database https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g54N3r6fb5JFrR03LHKQzCg1RBQqWijm (a Google account required) in your paper, please cite our paper:

The WPC2.0 database is composed of 400 V-PCC distorted point clouds and corresponding bitstreams whose original point clouds (Bag, Banana, Biscuits, Cake, Cauliflower, Flowerpot, House, Litchi, Mushroom, Ping-pong_bat, Puer_tea, Pumpkin, Ship, Statue, Stone, Tool_box) are from the WPC database. Each original point cloud are encoded by 5 geometry (geo) QPs {26,32,38,44,50} and 5 texture (col) QPs {26,32,38,44,50} respectively. The rest of the encoding parameters are set with default values. The subjective test settings and raw data processing are the same as those in the WPC database.
